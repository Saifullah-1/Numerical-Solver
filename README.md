# Numerical Solver GUI Application

This repository hosts a comprehensive GUI application for numerical analysis, consisting of two distinct phases.

## Phase 1: Linear Equation Solver

### Objective:
Compare and analyze the behavior of numerical methods for solving systems of linear equations.

### Implemented Methods:
1. Gauss Elimination
2. Gauss Jordan
3. LU Decomposition
4. Gauss Seidel
5. Jacobi Iteration

### Features:
- User-friendly GUI for equation input.
- Selection of solving methods via a drop-down list.
- Parameter input for selected methods.
- Precision control for results.
- Step-by-step simulation visualization.
- Automatic application of partial pivoting.

## Phase 2: Non-Linear Root Finder

### Objective:
Extend the application to include root-finding capabilities for non-linear equations.

### Implemented Methods:
1. Bisection
2. False-Position
3. Fixed Point
4. Original Newton-Raphson
5. Modified Newton-Raphson
6. Secant Method

### Features:
- Free-text input for non-linear equations.
- Function plotting for initial guesses.
- Method selection via a drop-down list.
- Parameter input for selected methods.
- Precision control (significant figures, EPS, max iterations).
- Step-by-step simulation visualization.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the GUI application.
3. Input your equations, choose methods, and explore numerical analysis capabilities.
